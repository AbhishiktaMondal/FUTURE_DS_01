# E-Commerce Sales Dashboard
This project features a comprehensive E-Commerce Sales Dashboard designed to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence. The goal was to provide stakeholders with a single, intuitive interface for tracking key metrics, understanding performance drivers, and identifying areas for strategic optimization.

## Key Insights and Analysis
The dashboard summarizes over $438K in Total Sales and $37K in Total Profit, offering deep dives into various performance dimensions:

### Revenue & Category Drivers:
Clothing is the dominant revenue generator, accounting for 63% of top categories, followed by Electronics at 21%.
The Monthly Sales Trend reveals clear seasonality, with strong performance in the early months and a significant recovery/peak in November/December, while showing periods of negative profit in mid-year (June/July).

### Profitability Analysis:
The Top 5 Profit by Sub-Category is dominated by high-margin items like Printers and Bookcases, providing clear targets for inventory focus and marketing efforts.

### Geographic & Customer Focus:
Maharashtra is the leading region, driving 37% of regional performance, with Madhya Pradesh at 32%. This highlights key markets for targeted investment.
Harnesh and Madhav are identified as the top-performing customers.

### Operational Insights:
An analysis of Quantity by Payment Mode shows COD (Cash on Delivery) as the preferred method, followed by UPI, providing insights for payment processing and logistics optimization.
